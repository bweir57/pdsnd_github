### Project Title
Bikeshare Project


### Description

The intent was to create an interactive experience that provided insight into Bikeshare data from Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C., filtered as desired by the user. The script requests info from the user regarding the city and time frame with which to filter the data, while accounting for inaccurate input. It then displays descriptive statistics about the data, such as the most popular stations, common travel times, average and total trip duration, and information about the bike users.

### Files used

Three data files were used, including chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv. The script itself is then contained in BikeShareProj.py.
